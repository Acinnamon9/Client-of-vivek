# Task List - January 27, 2026

## UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] **Hero Section Rollback**: Revert the hero section to the previous version.
- [ ] **Section 2 Card Layout**: Implement the `ravan.ai` style card layout in Section 2.
- [ ] **Onboarding Animation**: Implement the "pretty" onboarding animation seen on `neurocall` and `callers.ai`.
- [ ] **Expand Buttons Animation**: Make the expand buttons for "Sector Power" and "24/7 AI Sales Force" more "jumpy" (distracting but subtle enough to avoid issues).
- [ ] **"Still Deciding?" Section**: Add this section to the bottom of the page (check existing code).
- [ ] **Compliance Icons**: Add compliance icons to the footer (source: `callers.ai`).

## Component Refinement
- [ ] **Cost of Seconds**: Fix the 3 images that are currently too small.
- [ ] **Core Philosophy Diagram**: 
    - Add more icons to the diagram.
    - Refine the diagram to look more polished and "worked on".

## Bug Fixes & Diagnostics
- [ ] **Calculator Currency Fetching**: Diagnose why the calculator is not automatically fetching the user's possible currency.
